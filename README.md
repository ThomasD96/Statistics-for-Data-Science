# Statistics-for-Data-Science
In this course, I explored probability and descriptive statistics, covered data analysis from both a Frequentist and Bayesian viewpoint
and learned to extract insight from datasets. I learned to form hypotheses, design experiments that collect valid data, and test the 
hypotheses using statistical techniques.

### Assignment 1
The random permutation test is implemented in place of a t-test to assign significance to a difference between two groups as explained
by John Rauser in his keynote video ["Statistics Without the Agonizing Pain"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Dnw46eC-0o&feature=emb_title)

### Assignment 2
Python implementation of Monty Hall Problem and solution of probability problems from [OpenIntro Statistics 3rd edition](http://www.tf.uns.ac.rs/~omorr/radovan_omorjan_003_prII/r-examples/os3.pdf)

### Assignment 3
Solutions Implementation on Inference problems (Confidence Interval, Hypothesis Testing, p-value)

### Assignment 4
__Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS):__
- Linearity check (using scatter plots) and apply transformations if relation is not linear
- Evaluate the validity of the linear assumptions i.e. linearity, homoscedasticity, independence and normality on each dataset using Residuals Plot, Scale-location Plot and Normal QQ Plot.
- Generate OLS full summary report for the original and the transformed data
- Interpretation of the slope and intercept in relation to the original data
- Outlier detection and removal (also determine the leverage points) using Cook's Plot and Influence Plot

### Assignment 5
Inference Analysis for a single proportion when the success-failure condition is not met and the sample size is too small to apply the normal model

### Assignment 6
Bayesian Analysis of stock return data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (MCMC)
